## üöÄ Overview

CodeCraft Agents is an advanced multi-agent AI system that automatically converts natural language descriptions into production-ready code. The project demonstrates the power of specialized AI agents working in collaboration to handle the entire software development lifecycle - from task analysis to deployment.

**Note:** This is a prototype version currently optimized for single-file applications.

## ‚ú® Key Features

- **Fully Automated Code Generation** - From concept to working code with minimal human intervention
- **Multi-Agent Architecture** - Specialized agents for each development stage
- **Comprehensive Verification** - Built-in testing, validation, and feedback loops
- **Docker Integration** - Automatic containerization of generated applications
- **Knowledge Extraction** - Continuous learning from generated solutions

## ü§ñ Agent System Architecture

Our system employs a specialized agent for each stage of the development process:

1. **DecomposerAgent** - Breaks down the task description into structured modules and interfaces
2. **ValidatorAgent** - Verifies the completeness and correctness of the plan
3. **ConsistencyAgent** - Checks for data type and logic consistency across modules
4. **CodeGeneratorAgent** - Creates the actual code based on the approved plan
5. **CodeExtractorAgent** - Saves the code to appropriate files
6. **DockerRunnerAgent** - Generates Dockerfile and docker-compose configurations
7. **TesterAgent** - Creates test cases and validates application functionality
8. **DocumentationAgent** - Generates comprehensive usage documentation
9. **MonitorAgent** & **CoordinatorAgent** - Oversee the process and manage workflow transitions

## üîÑ How It Works

When you provide a task description to CodeCraft Agents, the system follows this workflow:

1. **Task Analysis** - The DecomposerAgent breaks down the task into manageable components
2. **Planning & Validation** - The system creates and verifies a comprehensive development plan
3. **Code Generation** - Clean, efficient code is created based on the approved plan
4. **Testing & Containerization** - The code is thoroughly tested and packaged in a Docker container
5. **Documentation** - Comprehensive usage documentation is automatically generated

The entire process is governed by our adaptive feedback loop, which ensures high-quality output through multiple verification layers.

## üìã Example Use Case

Given a simple input:

```
Create an API server with route /sum that takes two GET parameters a and b (numbers) and returns their sum. Use aiohttp.
```

CodeCraft Agents will produce:

1. A working Python application with error handling and proper structure
2. Dockerized environment for easy deployment
3. Test suite to verify functionality
4. Comprehensive documentation for usage and deployment

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Implementation

The system is built on a modular architecture that includes:

- Advanced prompt engineering for specialized agent roles
- Verification mechanisms for quality control
- Adaptive feedback loops for error correction
- Isolated execution environments for testing
- Vector knowledge base for context enhancement

## üîç Current Limitations

As a prototype, CodeCraft Agents currently has some limitations:

- Optimized for single-file Python applications
- Works best with web API and basic utility applications
- Limited complexity in database relationships and authentication
- Does not yet support full-scale multi-file projects

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.9 or higher
- Docker and docker-compose
- Access to OpenRouter API
- Qdrant for vector storage

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/codecraft-agents.git
cd codecraft-agents
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Start Qdrant using docker-compose:
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

4. Set your OpenRouter API key:
```bash
export OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your_key_here
```

### Usage

Run the system with a task description:

```bash
python main.py
```

By default, the system will generate code for a sample task. To customize, edit the `task` variable in `main.py`.

Output files will be created in the `project/` directory.
